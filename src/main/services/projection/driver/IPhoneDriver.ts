/**
 * Common contract for all phone-projection drivers (dongle, aa, cp).
 *
 * Each driver is an EventEmitter that, once `start(cfg)` resolves,
 * pumps decoded readable messages and lifecycle events to ProjectionService.
 * ProjectionService is the single meeting point — it bridges driver output
 * into the renderer pipeline regardless of which driver is active.
 *
 * Required events
 * ---------------
 *   'message'        (msg: Message)        — decoded LIVI-domain message
 *   'config-changed' (patch: Partial<Config>)
 *                                          — phone reported a config delta
 *   'failure'        ()                    — driver layer is dead, restart needed
 *
 * Optional driver-specific events (e.g. 'dongle-info', 'targeted-connect-dispatched')
 * remain on the concrete class and are NOT part of this contract.
